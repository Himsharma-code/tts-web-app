## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Audio Recording**: Due to browser security limitations, direct audio recording of the speech synthesis output is generally **not supported** by the Web Speech API. If you need to record the audio, please use your system's audio recording software.
- **Pause/Resume**: The `pause` and `resume` functionalities of the Web Speech API are known to be unreliable and inconsistently supported across different browsers. For a more stable experience, this application focuses on reliable "Play" and "Stop" controls.
- **Voice Availability**: The available voices depend entirely on the user's operating system and browser.
